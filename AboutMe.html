             It all started after I had a car accident. Now my migraines come back all the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                1. My diagnosis is: Common migraine<br>
                
                2. My migraine attack frequency is: 2-3 times a week<br>
                
                3. I was diagnosed in: 2003<br>
                
                4. I take 6 medications/supplements each day for prevention and 2 medications/supplements to treat an acute attack<br>
                
                5. My first migraine attack was: at age 28. They started out regularly on the 5th day after the start of my menstrual period. They, of course, they expanded to having a range of other triggers.<br>
                
                6. My most disabling migraine symptoms are: Pain, confusion, fatigue<br>
                
                7. My strangest migraine symptoms are: word retrieval problems<br>
                
                8. My biggest migraine triggers are: trigger foods, sunlight, too much exercise, too little or too much sleep, weather changes, humidity, perfumed hair products or skin lotion,<br>
                
                9. I know a migraine attack is coming on when: I get a dull pain in the side of my head, neck or shoulder<br>
                
                10. The most frustrating part about having a migraine attack is: lower functioning at work<br>
                
                11. During a migraine attack, I worry most about: getting through work<br>
                
                12. When I think about migraine between attacks, I think: I hope I can figure out a way to prevent them<br>
                
                13. When I tell someone I have migraine, the response is usually: understanding (except from my spouse, who is fed up with them)<br>
                
                14. When someone tells me they have migraine, I think: oh my gosh, I completely understand how devastating they are<br>
                
                15. When I see commercials about migraine treatments, I think: they completely minimize what people experience<br>
                
                16. My best coping tools are: taking meds., finding time to nap, pacing myself at work, not taking on more than I can handle<br>
                
                17. I find comfort in: relaxation<br>
                
                19. I get angry when people say: just push yourself, or it’s all caused by stress, or exercise will solve your problems<br>
                
                20. I like it when people say: I completely understand and I can’t believe you can still work and function as much as you do with migraines<br>
                
                21. Something kind someone can do for me during a migraine attack is: let me rest and relax<br>
                
                22. The best thing(s) a doctor has ever said to me about migraine is: there are more solutions out there<br>
                
                23. The hardest thing to accept about having migraine is: how it has limited my life choices – I cannot do certain things in terms of work, travel, social activities because of it<br>
                
                24. Migraine has taught me: what it is like to have a chronic illness and how it affects you<br>
                
                25. The quotation, motto, mantra, or scripture that gets me through an attack is:<br>
                
                
                26. If I could go back to the early days of my diagnosis, I would tell myself: I wouldn’t. I would have gotten depressed if I had known how long-lasting and chronic it would have gotten.<br>
                
                27. The people who support me most are: friends<br>
                
                28. The thing I most wish people understood about migraine is: It affects you not only when you experience the pain, but all the time – It affects daily choices in terms of work, play, food, activity, travel, exercise, just about every choice you make because you are always trying to avoid triggers. It forces you to be overly cautious, or you pay for even minor transgressions that are merely a part of life for others.<br>
                
                29. Migraine and Headache Awareness Month is important to me because: It spreads awareness to others about the effect it has on sufferers<br>
                
                30. One more thing I’d like to say about life with migraine is: I appreciate the work you do with your site.
